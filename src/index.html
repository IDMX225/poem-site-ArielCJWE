      <p>All night I lay on Devil's Edge,<br>
          Along an overhanging ledge<br>
          Between the sky and sea:<br>
          And as I rested 'waiting sleep,<br>
          The windless sky and soundless deep<br>
          In one dim, blue infinity<br>
          Of starry peace encompassed me.<br>
          <br>And I remembered, drowsily,<br>
          How 'mid the hills last night I'd lain<br>
          Beside a singing moorland burn;<br>
          And waked at dawn, to feel the rain<br>
          Fall on my face, as on the fern<br>
          That drooped about my heather-bed;<br>
          And how by noon the wind had blown<br>
          The last grey shred from out the sky,<br>
          And blew my homespun jacket dry,<br>
          As I stood on the topmost stone<br>
          That crowns the cairn on Hawkshaw Head,<br>
          And caught a gleam of far-off sea;<br>
          And heard the wind sing in the bent<br>
          Like those far waters calling me:<br>
          When, my heart answering to the call,<br>
          I followed down the seaward stream,<br>
          By silent pool and singing fall;<br>
          Till with a quiet, keen content,<br>
          I watched the sun, a crimson ball,<br>
          Shoot through grey seas a fiery gleam,<br>
          Then sink in opal deeps from sight.<br>
          <br>And with the coming on of night,<br>
          The wind had dropped: and as I lay,<br>
          Retracing all the happy day,<br>
          And gazing long and dreamily<br>
          Across the dim, unsounding sea,<br>
          Over the far horizon came<br>
          A sudden sail of amber flame;<br>
          And soon the new moon rode on high<br>
          Through cloudless deeps of crystal sky.<br>
          <br>Too holy seemed the night for sleep;<br>
          And yet, I must have slept, it seems;<br>
          For, suddenly, I woke to hear<br>
          A strange voice singing, shrill and clear,<br>
          Down in a gully black and deep<br>
          That cleft the beetling crag in twain.<br>
          It seemed the very voice of dreams<br>
          That drive hag-ridden souls in fear<br>
          Through echoing, unearthly vales,<br>
          To plunge in black, slow-crawling streams,<br>
          Seeking to drown that cry, in vain ...<br>
          Or some sea creature's voice that wails<br>
          Through blind, white banks of fog unlifting<br>
          To God-forgotten sailors drifting<br>
          Rudderless to death ...<br>
          And as I heard,<br>
          Though no wind stirred,<br>
          An icy breath<br>
          Was in my hair ...<br>
          And clutched my heart with cold despair ...<br>
          But, as the wild song died away,<br>
          There came a faltering break<br>
          That shivered to a sobbing fall;<br>
          And seemed half-human, after all ...<br>
          <br>And yet, what foot could find a track<br>
          In that deep gully, sheer and black ...<br>
          And singing wildly in the night!<br>
          So, wondering I lay awake,<br>
          Until the coming of the light<br>
          Brought day's familiar presence back.<br>
          <br> Down by the harbour-mouth that day.<br>
          A fisher told the tale to me.<br>
          Three months before, while out at sea,<br>
          Young Philip Burn was lost, though how,<br>
          None knew, and none would ever know.<br>
          The boat becalmed at noonday lay ...<br>
          And not a ripple on the sea ...<br>
          And Philip standing in the bow,<br>
          When his six comrades went below<br>
          To sleep away an hour or so,<br>
          Dog-tired with working day and night,<br>
          While he kept watch ... and not a sound<br>
          They heard, until, at set of sun<br>
          They woke; and coming up they found<br>
          The deck was empty, Philip gone ...<br>
          Yet not another boat in sight ...<br>
          And not a ripple on the sea.<br>
          How he had vanished, none could tell.<br>
          They only knew the lad was dead<br>
          They'd left but now, alive and well ...<br>
          And he, poor fellow, newly-wed ...<br>
          And when they broke the news to her,<br>
          She spoke no word to anyone:<br>
          But sat all day, and would not stir,<br>
          Just staring, staring in the fire,<br>
          With eyes that never seemed to tire;<br>
          Until, at last, the day was done,<br>
          And darkness came; when she would rise,<br>
          And seek the door with queer, wild eyes;<br>
          And wander singing all the night<br>
          Unearthly songs beside the sea:<br>
          But always the first blink of light<br>
          Would find her back at her own door.<br>
          <br>'Twas Winter when I came once more<br>
          To that old village by the shore;<br>
          And as, at night, I climbed the street,<br>
          I heard a singing, low and sweet,<br>
          Within a cottage near at hand:<br>
          And I was glad awhile to stand<br>
          And listen by the glowing pane:<br>
          And as I hearkened, that sweet strain<br>
          Brought back the night when I had lain<br>
          Awake on Devil's Edge ...<br>
          And now I knew the voice again,<br>
          So different, free of pain and fear,<br>
          Its terror turned to tenderness,<br>
          And yet the same voice none the less,<br>
          Though singing now so true and clear:<br>
          And drawing nigh the window-ledge,<br>
          I watched the mother sing to rest<br>
          The baby snuggling to her breast.</p>
